# VSMod-YEET
A simple (if over-engineered) mod for [Vintage Story](https://www.vintagestory.at/). YEET adds a "Hard Throw" hotkey (default: Y) which throws 1, all, or half of the items in the player's active itemslot at a 45 degree upward angle with much greater force than the default drop command.

YEET is highly configurable. Adjust the force of the throw, the satiety cost, audio volume and range (for multiplayer), and more!
